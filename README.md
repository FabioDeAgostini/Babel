# Babel
Revit addin for translated, multilanguage tags

# Concept
This is the starting point for a multilanguage annotations on a Revit project.
The core idea is to using the multicategory tags and reading multiple keynote files (or similar txt files) or, on a missing translation, creating it on the fly with google translator. 
Later it can use the same approach also with text notes and other text annotations.
Native keynotes cannot have custom parameters so, they cannot be implemented due to software limitations.
